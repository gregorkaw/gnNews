# Instructions

Unfortunately the newsAPI doesn't allow non-profit accounts to deploy webpage and have access to the database, so the only way to look at this project is to run it locally.
To do this you have to:

1. Get a free API key from https://newsapi.org/
2. Set it as an enviromental variable in `.env` and call it `VITE_NEWS_API_KEY`
3. You can run with `npm run dev` command.
